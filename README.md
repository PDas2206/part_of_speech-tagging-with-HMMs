# part_of_speech-tagging-with-HMMs
We implement a bigram part-of-speech (POS) tagger based on Hidden Markov Models (without using NLTK except for the modules explicitly listed below). The project is divided into the following modules:
1. Corpus reader and writer
2. Training procedure, including smoothing
3. Viterbi tagging, including unknown word handling
4. Evaluation
